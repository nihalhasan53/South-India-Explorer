                                    <p>Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, also known as the Simhadri, is a beautiful Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Narasimha. Situated on a hilltop, the shrine is believed to be the holy abode of Varaha Narasimha Swami, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.</p> 
                                    <p>Representing a blend of Orissan and Chalukyan architectural styles, the temple is believed to have been constructed in 1098 by the famous Chola king, Kuloththunga. The queen of ancient Orissa covered the image with gold, between 1137 and 1156. Furthermore, Narasimha Deva, the king of the Eastern Ganga Kingdom in Orissa, constructed the central shrine in 1267.</p> 
                                    <p>The shrine was visited twice by Sri Krishna Deva Raya in 1516 and 1519, after defeating Gajapati Prataparudra Dev, a Gajapati ruler of Orissa. He offered jewellery to the deity, along with a huge bhogam, out of which a beautiful necklace is still preserved in the temple. The idol resembles a Shiva Lingam that is enshrined within the inner sanctum of the temple.</p> 
                                    <p>The Shiva Lingam remains covered with sandal paste and other holy pastes throughout the year. Apart from beautifully carved stone idols, the temple also has a statue of a stone chariot drawn by seven horses. It is 20.3 kilometers from visakhapatnam.</p>
