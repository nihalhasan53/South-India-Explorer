Legend has it that while the Sage Agastya was performing his penance, crows disturbed him and he cursed that the crows cannot enter the place. As the crow is the Vahana for Lord Shani, it is believed that Shani cannot enter this place. It is 45 kilometers from Kurnool.</p>

                                    <p>The Belum Caves is the largest and longest cave system open to the public on the Indian subcontinent, known for its speleothems, such as stalactite and stalagmite formations. The Belum Caves have long passages, galleries, spacious caverns with fresh water and siphons.</p> 
                                    <p>This natural cave system was formed over the course of tens of thousands of years by the constant flow of underground water. The cave system reaches its deepest point ( 46 m (151 ft) from entrance level) at the point known as Pataalaganga.</p> 
                                    <p>In Telugu language, it is called Belum Guhalu. Belum Caves have a length of 3,229 m (10,593.8 ft), making them the second largest natural caves on the Indian Subcontinent after the Krem Liat Prah caves in Meghalaya. It is one of the centrally protected monuments of national importance.Belum came to scientific attention in 1884 by a British surveyor, Robert Bruce Foote.</p> 
                                    <p>Today, 3.5 km (2.2 mi) of the caves have been successfully explored, though only 1.5 km (0.9 mi) is accessible to visitors. There are 16 different pathways, including the main entrance and there are deposits of quartz in the caves. The caves consist of black limestone.</p> 
                                    <p>The Belum Caves are located near Belum Village in Kolimigundla Mandal of Kurnool District in the state of Andhra Pradesh.

                                    <p>The fortifications upon the mountains are often weak...To the south of Adoni, a large plain, to the north there are mountains, obnoxious from their nearness, to the east there are other mountains. To the west there are also mountains and this part is the weakest.</p>
                                    <p>"In the 15th century and early to mid 16th century, Adoni was a fort town of the Vijayanagara Empire. It was held by the kinsmen of Aliya Rama Raya, a powerful aristocrat of the Vijayanagara. It is 98.5 kilometers from Kurnool.</p>

                                    <p>Ahobilam is located in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh in the hills of the eastern ghats, about 400 KM northwest of Chennai. The temple consists of nine shrines to Lord Narisimha located around a 5 KM circle. In addition to the nine shrines, there is a temple for Prahaladavarada Varadhan in the foothills of the mountain.</p> 
                                    <p>Garuda wished for a vision of Lord Narisimha in the form of the Avathara. To fulfill his wish, the Lord settled in the hills around Ahobilam in the midst of dense forests in nine different forms. For this reason this hill came to be known as Garudadri, Garudachalam, and Garudasailam.</p> 
                                    <p>Ahobilam is the place where the Lord killed Hiranyakasipu and saved Prahalada. Mahalakshmi took avathar as Senjulakshmi among the Senju, tribal hunters of the hills, and married the Lord. It is 140.4 kilometers from Kurnool.</p>

                                    <p>Mahanandi, is a village located east of the Nallamala Hills near Nandyal, Kurnool District, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is surrounded by forests. Within 15 km of Mahanandi, there are nine Nandi shrines known as Nava nandulu.</p> 
                                    <p>Mahanandi is one of the Nava Nandis. The Mahanandiswara Swamy Temple, an important shrine, is located here. This ancient temple dates back over 1,500 years. The inscriptions of 10th century tablets speak of the temple being repaired and rebuilt several times.</p> 
                                    <p>The main temple is surrounded by three pools: two small pools at the entrance and one big pool inside the temple itself. This holy tank is 60 square feet (5.6 m2) with an outdoor pavilion called a mandapa in the centre.</p> 
                                    <p>The inlets and outlets of the tank are arranged so that the depth of the water is constantly kept at five feet, thus enabling pilgrims to bathe in the holy waters. The water source originates at the Garbhagruha (inner shrine) just below Swayambhu Linga. One can touch the water near the Shiva Linga . The devotees can offer prayers and touch the Shiva Linga.</p> 
                                    <p>This is unusual, because traditionally at temples, the main deity is kept away from the touch of the devotees.The water is famous for its crystalline and healing qualities and is ever tepid. The outgoing water irrigates 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) of fertile land surrounding the village. It is 96.6 kilometers from kunool.</p>
