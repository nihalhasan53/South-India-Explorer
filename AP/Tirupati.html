                                    <p>The Temple is dedicated to Lord Sri Venkateswara, an incarnation of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared here to save mankind from trials and troubles of Kali Yuga. The Temple is constructed in Dravidian architecture and is believed to be constructed over a period of time starting from 300 AD.</p><p>Tirumala is located 3,200 feet (980 m) above sea level and covers an area of approximately 10.33 square miles (26.8 km2). Surrounding the hills are seven peaks of Seshachalam range, Eastern Ghats namely Seshadri, Neeladri, Garudadri, Anjanadri, Vrushabadri, Narayanadri and Venkatadri. The temple of Sri Venkateswara is on the seventh peak (Venkatadri).</p> 
                                    <p>In ancient literature Tirupati is mentioned as Aadhi Varaha Kshetra. The Puranas associate the site with Lord Varaha, one of the Dashavatara of Lord Vishnu. In Varaha Purana, Venkatadri is believed to be a part of Mount Meru, which was brought on to the earth from Vishnu's abode Vaikuntam by his mount Garuda. The seven peaks represent the seven heads of Adisesha. It is 22.2 kilometers from tirupati.</p>

                                    <p>Kanipakam is home to a popular Hindu temple of Lord Ganesha called as Kanipakam Vinayaka Temple. It was constructed in the early 11th century CE by the pandian King Maravarman sundara pandian and a siva temple by Kulothunga Chola I and was expanded further in 1336 by the Emperors of Vijayanagara dynasty. </p> 
                                    <p>An unbelievable truth about the divine image of Lord Vinayak of Kanipakam is that the idol is reportedly growing in size with the passage of time. Currently, only the knees and abdomen of the idol are visible.</p> 
                                    <p>The testimony to the fact is the silver kavacham (armour) offered to the idol by one of the ardent devotees about fifty years ago, which does not fit the idol today! It is 67.2 kilometers from tirupati.</p>

It is one of the most famous Shiva temples in South India, and is said to be the site where Kannappa was ready to offer both his eyes to cover blood flowing from the Siva linga before the Lord Siva stopped him and granted him mukti.</p>

                                    <p>The temple is revered as one of the Pancha Bhoota Stalam where the presiding deity is worshipped as Vayu linga(air). This temple is considered "Kashi of the South". Saivaite saints of the first century sang about this temple. This is the only temple in India which remains open during Solar and lunar eclipses, while, all other temples are closed.</p> 
                                    <p>This temple is famous for Rahu-Kethu pooja. It is believed that performing this pooja will ward the people from astrological effects of Rahu and Kethu. As per Hindu legend, Kalahatiswara was worshipped at this place by Brahma during all four Yugas. Arjuna, the Pandava prince during Mahabharata is believed to have worshipped the presiding deity.</p>
