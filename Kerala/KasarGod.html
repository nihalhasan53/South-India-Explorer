                                    <p>Famed to be the largest and one of the best preserved forts in Kerala, ‘Bekal Fort’ spreads over 40 acres of land near Pallikkara village of Kasargod district and runs into the bay waters of the sea towards its south. A fort with great historical and archaeological significance built in mid-17th century by the Shivappa Nayaks of Badnore, it attracts hundreds of historians and archaeologists alike who come here to study and unfold its hidden mysteries.</p> 
                                    <p>The fort which once served as a nucleus in establishing the control of the Badnore Nayaka rulers in the region was subsequently captured by the Mysore ruler, Hyder Ali in 1763 and thereafter, continued as one of the important military stations for the Tipu Sultan led army working on the mission to expand their hold over Malabar.</p> 
                                    <p>Many archaeological excavations done in and around the ‘Bekal Fort’ have revealed coins and other interesting artefacts indicating the strong foothold of Mysore sultans in the region. In 1799, with the death of Tipu Sultan, the fort fell into the hands of the British East India Company and remained under their administration until India gained independence.</p> 
                                    <p>As the fort exchanged hands with many ruling powers, considerable changes and improvements were brought in its structure by each dynasty. The most significant of all the additions done in the fort is by far, the tall observation tower built during the times of Tipu Sultan; a rare feature of the then forts, the tower was strategically erected at such a position that it could easily aid in discovering even the smallest of the movements of its enemies.</p> 
                                    <p>And yes, the breath-taking views of the beautiful ocean and scenery around from this tower still captivate many. Of late, the fort, flanked by lush greenery and majestic sea, has become a favourite hotspot for shooting films, TV serials and music videos; off-course the credit goes to the ace filmmaker Mani Rathnam who started the trend by shooting the beautiful song ‘Tu hi re’ from his famous movie ‘Bombay’ at this exotic locale.It is 15.7km from kasarGod</p>
