                                    <p>Located near Alappuzha, ‘Krishnapuram Palace’ is yet another of the famous heritage tourism places in Kerala. Built in 18th century by the then maharaja of the kingdom of Travancore in South India, the palace reflects a typical Kerala style of architecture with pitched roofs, dormer windows and thin corridors.</p> 
                                    <p>Enlisted as a protected monument under the state archaeology department, the palace has today been converted into an archaeological museum and exhibits a rare collection of fascinating mural paintings, the most noteworthy of which is the 49 square metres long ‘Gajendra Moksham’. Depicting an elephant (Gajendra) worshipping Lord Vishnu in full devotion, the painting is the largest of its kind so far discovered in Kerala.</p> 
                                    <p>Another of the major highlights of the palace is a Buddha mandapam enshrining a Buddha statue, one of the four ancient Buddha relics found in the Alappuzha district.Other interesting artefacts to be seen inside the palace complex are some fine collections of early coins of the Travancore kingdom, bronze sculptures and stone inscriptions; a double edged sword called the ‘Kayamkulam Vaal’ is yet another of the prized possession of this palace cum museum.</p> 
                                    <p>Needless to say, a heaven for historians, a visit to this ancient palace which is actually a miniature replica of the Padmanabhapuram Palace is sure to leave you awed with its antiques and off-course, the bewitching architecture that has further been beautified with addition of ornate terraced gardens dotted with fountains, ponds and flower beds. One can sit here for hours soaking himself in the serene and tranquil aura of the place. It is 48.2 kilometers from alappuzha.</p>

                                    <p>Protected by the state archaeological department, ‘Karumadikuttan’ is one of the popular heritage and Buddhist pilgrimage sites near Alappuzha in Kerala, housing a pre-historic statue of Lord Buddha dating somewhere between 9th and 13th centuries AD. The 3ft. tall statue sculpted in black granite, with its left side missing, is believed to have been abandoned for centuries in the nearby water stream of ‘Karumady thodu’ and was found by a British engineer in 1930s who later built a shrine to protect this ancient relic.</p> 
                                    <p>The shrine today, sits along the backwaters of the ‘Punnamada Lake’ amidst extreme tranquillity and provides for a huge respite to people looking out for mental peace and calm. Needless to say, the site also serves as a great reminder of the once flourishing Buddhist culture in the region, luring countless Buddhist pilgrims and researchers & scholars studying ancient cultures of India.</p> 
                                    <p>What instantly grabs your attention when you see the statue for the first time is its missing left side that leaves you with many questions unanswered regarding its broken state. Well! many theories relate to it but, none has been confirmed by the historians owing to lack of evidences.</p> 
                                    <p>The first and rather much believable theory that explains this condition of the statue is the violent act of Mughals who destroyed it in order to cease the spread of Buddhism in Kerala. Yet another theory which is precisely more of a folklore describes it to be the act of an enraged elephant who, in his fit of anger destroyed the statue’s left side. Whatever be the theory, the statue in its meditative stance continues to bless its visitors giving them the message of peace, harmony and one-ness among all humans. It is 3 kilometers from alappuzha.</p>

                                    <p>At a distance of 15 Kilometers from Pathanamthitta, 52.4 Kilometers from Alappuzha & 57 Km from Kumarakom, Aranmula is a Aranmula Snake Boat Race, also known as Aranmula Vallamkali is a popular boat race held in the never ending Kerala Backwaters. This is an annual boat race held in Aranmula district of Kerala during the Onam festival in the month of August-September. It is also known as Uthrittathi Boat Race.</p> 
                                    <p>Aranmula Vallamkali owes its origin to the Sri Parthasarathy Temple situated on the banks of the Pamba River. The Vallamkali, associated with the annual festival of Sri Parthasarathy, is usually held on the last two days of the festival. The event that attracts tourists from all over the world is conducted not to win any trophy or prize but to celebrate the anniversary of the Sri Krishna idol installation, the main deity at the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple.</p> 
                                    <p>It is conducted in the Pamba River in front of the temple to commemorate the crossing of the river by Lord Krishna.The snake boats assemble near the Parthasarathy Temple before the race begins. Festivities take over the whole town as well as the waters. The boat race is famous worldwide and has become an icon of Kerala, attracting thousands of tourists every year during the festival of Onam.</p>
                                    <p>This annual boat race during Onam attracts tourists from all over India and the world. The snake boats are called 'Palliyodams' and their structures resemble snakes. These boats are around 100 feet in length, have narrow fronts with raised hoods and rear portions towering at a height of around 20 ft. Around 40 boats participate in this annual event and each boat accommodates about 120 people including helmsmen, oarsmen and singers.</p> 
                                    <p>Colorful and vivid flags are set on the boat's head and colorful parasol in the center offers a beautiful spectacle. The race begins in the afternoon after the morning prayers and rituals. Songs called 'Vanchipattu' are sung during the races. Groups of men and singers who sing stridently in a rhythmic manner gather along the banks of the rivers and in snake boats.</p> 
                                    <p>The speed and the graceful rhythmic movements of the boat offer an amazing show. After the water sport there is an elaborate feast in the Aranmula temple. Aranmula Vallamkali, organised under the sponsorship of Palliyoda Seva Sangam, is more of a water festival than a competition. For the past few years, the Central Tourism Ministry has been providing financial assistance for preserving and promoting this legendary snake boat race.</p>
