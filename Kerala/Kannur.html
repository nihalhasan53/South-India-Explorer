                                    <p>Built in early 18th century by the British East India Company in small town of Thalassery in Kannur district of Kerala, the ‘Thalassery Fort’ stands as an imposing structure with massive walls, strong bastions and grandiose doors embellished with elaborate carvings. A testament to impressive engineering skills of the then British engineers and designers, the fort encloses a number of secretive tunnels and underground chambers that once served as hiding burrows for the defeated British military personnel.</p><p>Sitting on a rocky cliff right on the edge of the beautiful Malabar Coast and flanked by lush gardens, it provides for an ideal ambience to get some taste of regional history and heritage. You can either go for leisurely walks along the fort’s expansive ramparts and revel yourselves in some panoramic views of the turquoise sea or just relax and spend a laid-back time in its well-manicured lawns.</p> 
                                    <p>And needless to say, before all the recreational stuff, taking a tour of the fort is an absolute must; as you go around the fortified walls, you are sure to be intrigued with many interesting stories associated with it; be it the imprisonment of the army of Mysore ruler, Hyder Ali or strategizing the capture of Pazhassi Raja, a great Indian freedom fighter popularly known as the ‘Lion of Kerala’, the fort has stood as a silent witness to many conspiracies planned by the British officials in the past to had their controls secured over the Malabar region.</p> 
                                    <p>This historical fort today, is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and indeed, they have done a great job, making it an absolute delight for visitors who have a penchant for history and architecture. So, if you are also amongst those avid history buffs, a visit here definitely has to be marked on your travel itineraries.It is 21.5km from Kannur</p>

                                    <p>‘Gundert Bungalow’, the residence of Dr. Hermann Gundert, a renowned German scholar and missionary of his times who lived here between 1839 and 1859, is undoubtedly, one of the most significant heritage sites in Kerala. Located amidst tall palms in small town of Thalassery in Kannur district of Kerala, the 200 years old bungalow with its typical colonial mansion style architecture, stands tall as a witness to many great works of literature and lexicography by the legendary scholar who spent most of his time researching the classical Indian literature and learning new languages.</p> 
                                    <p>No less than a living piece of history, you would be amazed to know that the first daily newspaper in Malayalam, ‘Rajyasamacharam’, the first Malayalam magazine, ‘Paschimodayam’ and the first Malayalam-English dictionary took birth in this heritage building only.</p> 
                                    <p>Gundert’s other works comprising of a Malayalam grammar compilation, a thesis on neo classical history of Kerala after the arrival of Vasco da Gama and contributions towards Bible translation in Malayalam, are counted amongst the most precious and are kept well-preserved in the bungalow for public viewing. Till date, Dr. Gundert is held in high regards by linguistic experts in Kerala and is honoured with a grand statue in his remembrance. Needless to say, if you are a literary lover or a history enthusiast, this place is a must see during your holidays in Kerala.It is 21.5km from Kannur</p>
