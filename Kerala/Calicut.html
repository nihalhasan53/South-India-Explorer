The shipbuilding yard here is renowned for the construction of Urus and Dhows, the traditional Arabian trading vessel. This craft is over 1500 years old now and is carried out carefully by the expert craftsmen who possess extraordinary skills.</p> 
                                    <p>In fact, the flagship of the British admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson who defeated Napoleon Bonaparte in the Battle of Trafalgar in the year 1805 was made in Beypore along with numerous other vessels of his celebrated fleet.
