                                    <p>Also famously called as the ‘Tipu’s Fort’, ‘Palakkad Fort’ built in 1766 AD by the Mysore Sultan, Haider Ali (father of Tipu Sultan), is definitely a gateway into Kerala’s intriguing past. Nestled amidst picturesque Sahayadri ranges of the Western Ghats, the fort with its thick granite walls and strong bastions, reminds every visitor of many of its tales of bloodshed, bravery and valour; it is from this fort that the Tiger of Mysore (Tipu Sultan), fought many battles against the colonial rule of British.</p> 
                                    <p>One of the well preserved forts by the Archaeological Survey of India, the Palakkad Fort is not only a great place to revel in some fascinating history but, also a site to marvel on the pristine beauty of nature. The landscaped lawns and a children’s park adjacent to the fort today, make it a favourite hotspot for family picnics and day outings. ‘Kotta Maidanam’ or the ‘Fort Grounds’ which once served as stable for horses and elephants of Tipu Sultan’s army, are now used as a ground for organizing local football and cricket matches.</p> 
                                    <p>A temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman is another interesting attraction inside the fort; known as the ‘Anjaneya Temple’, this temple enshrines an old carving of Lord Hanuman, believed to have been engraved by the warriors of Tipu Sultan’s army who had unshakeable faith in the prowess of the Lord. Even as of date, hundreds of locals visit this temple to pay their reverence to the almighty.</p> 
                                    <p>The old open air auditorium called ‘Rappadi‘, inside the fort is yet another noteworthy site that has recently been renovated by the archaeological department and serves as a venue for local musical and cultural events; if you are lucky enough, you might even get an opportunity to watch a live performance during your visit here.It is 3km from Palakkad.</p>
