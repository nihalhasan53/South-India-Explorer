                                    <p>Also commonly called as the ‘Paradesi Synagogue’ or ‘Mattancherry Synagogue’, the ‘Jewish Synagogue’ located in the small neighbourhood of Mattencherry in Old Cochin, dates back to 1568 and was built by the community of Paradesi Jews who once inhabited the Jew Town area in Kerala during the olden times.</p> 
                                    <p>The only functional synagogue of the total seven synagogues belonging to the Cochin’s Paradesi Jewish community, its exquisite architecture and splendid interiors decorated with glass chandeliers and vintage lamps, grab your immediate attention as soon as you step inside the abbey; the synagogue’s floor constructed with hand-painted blue willow tiles, specially imported from China in 18th century further adds to its artistic grandeur that never fails to impress its visitors.</p> 
                                    <p>Needless to say, the synagogue is a treasure trove of some valuable antiques which throw light on its glorious past; look out for the 4th century copper plates inscribed with Malayalam script, a hand-knotted oriental rug gifted by the last Ethiopian emperor and two gold crowns presented by the Hindu king of Cochin to the Jewish community as a testament to their harmonious relations. One of the most popular historical tourism places in Kerala, the synagogue today, with its fast dwindling population of Paradesi Jews, mostly remains empty and awaits for tourists who often come here to admire its beauty and to get a glimpse at its age-old history. It is 3.5 kilometers from cochin.</p>

                                    <p>Commonly referred to as ‘Mattencherry Palace’, the ‘Dutch Palace’ stands close to the ‘Jewish Synagogue’ in Jew Town area of Mattencherry neighbourhood and makes for yet another significant historical sightseeing places in Kerala. The palace was originally built by the Portuguese in 1557 which they later gifted to the king of Cochin not only as a compensation for their dreadful act of devastating a Hindu temple in the region but, also as a bribe for establishing trade relations with the kingdom.</p> 
                                    <p>In 1663, the palace was taken over by the Dutch who greatly revamped and improvised its structure. That is the reason, the palace is today, more popularly known as the ‘Dutch Palace’. With its simple white exteriors beautifully complementing the lush greenery and tall coconut trees that fringe the area, the palace is truly a sight to behold from inside; as soon as you step in the palace, you are flabbergasted to witness some breath-taking murals etched on its walls, depicting mythological scenes from Hindu epics of Ramayana, Mahabharata and other Puranic legends.</p> 
                                    <p>And yes! These murals are counted amongst the best of their kind in India.That is not all, the ‘Dutch Palace’ has many more elements to surprise its visitors; the intricately carved wooden ceiling of the coronation hall adorning the design of inverted lotus is sure to leave you spellbound. What further adds to the charm of the palace is its rare and antique collection of royal paraphernalia including furniture, weaponry, palanquins, costumes and life-size portraits of Kochi kings who ruled here in the bygone era.</p> 
                                    <p>Undoubtedly, a great place for history buffs and art enthusiasts, a visit to the ‘Dutch Palace’ would be no less than a walk in the past and is sure to leave you with some fascinating unknowns about the history of Kerala. It is 3.7 kilometers from cochin.</p>

                                    <p>Snuggled on the shores of the tropical Malabar Coast, ‘Fort Kochi’, the historic centre of the modern day Cochin city, is by far the most important historical places to visit in Kerala. Steeped in rich antiquity and dotted with scores of crumbling buildings and monuments that reminisce of the Dutch, Portuguese and British colonial raj in the country during bygone times, it is a place worth setting out on foot, listening to those intriguing yet ‘never-heard-before’ tales of the past.</p> 
                                    <p>As you venture on a tour of this once ‘melting hot-pot of cultures’ in South India, pause for a moment and marvel on the captivating vistas of the ‘Chinese Fishing Nets’ that precariously hang over the wooden cantilevers lined along the beach of this old town. Standing tall in their lustrous glory as a proud symbol of Kerala’s colonial legacy, these nets look even more surreal against the backdrop of the setting sun; no wonder, they are one of the most photographed attractions here and can be seen ornamenting official picture postcards and postal stamps of the state.</p> 
                                    <p>After a tiring day of walking around Fort Kochi, exploring its historical and cultural heritage attractions, if you feel worn out, settle down for some entertainment at the ‘Kerala Kathakali Centre’, an institute that work towards propagating different traditional art forms of Kerala; watch a magnificent Kathakali performance here and learn some interesting historical facts about this beautiful dance form during an insightful session with the brilliant Kathakali artists in person. Needless to say, a ‘must-visit’ on your Kerala Heritage tour, ‘Fort Kochi’ is always going to be etched in your memories for the lifetime. It is 6.3 kilometers from cochin.</p>

                                    <p>Built in 1503, ‘St. Francis Church’ holds the status of being the oldest European church in India. One of the most historically significant places in Kerala, which once stood as a quiet spectator to the struggle of different European colonial powers in the Indian subcontinent, the church today, attracts countless visitors from across the globe.</p> 
                                    <p>The architecture of this ancient church, though not very artistic and modern, still manages to grab all the admiration by the visitors; the stained glass windows and gorgeous porticoes flanked with stepped pinnacle just add to its old world charm. What further draws the attention of many, is its antique collection of hand-operated cloth fans that are till date, worked upon manually with ropes on either side.</p> 
                                    <p>Besides all that, what marks for the most important highlight of this church is its association with Vasco da Gama, the first Portuguese trader and voyager who landed on the Indian soil; the church is popular as the resting ground of this famous explorer who was buried here in 1524. Even though his mortal remains were sent back to Portugal 14 years later, the burial place still attracts many curious travellers from parts of the world.</p> 
                                    <p>One of the most significant of the numerous popular churches in India, ‘St. Francis Church’ has come a long way from being a Roman Catholic Church to a Reformist Church maintained by the Dutch to finally transforming into an Anglican Church. Today, this church is owned by CSI (Church of South India) and has become an integral part of Kochi’s identity. Tourists are welcome to visit this church any day of the week except Sundays and public holidays when it is busy hosting the regular prayer services for the locals. It is 6.4 kilometers from cochin.</p>
