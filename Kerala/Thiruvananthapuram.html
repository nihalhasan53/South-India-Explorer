                                    <h3 class="tm-text-green tm-font-400">Rock-Cut Cave Temples</h3>
                                    <p>One of the earliest ancient heritages of Kerala is its exquisite rock cut temples that even as of date, stand as a testament to this beautiful state’s exceptional cultural and architectural legacy. The most famous of these cave temples is the ‘Kottukal Cave Temple’ located in Kollam district of Kerala. Built between 6th and 8th century, the temple is one of its kind and gives the illusion of a sleeping elephant when seen from a distance.</p> 
                                    <p>A living example of the traditional architectural excellence prevalent in bygone times, the temple amalgamates two chambers of different sizes carved out from a single gigantic rock and enshrines the deities of Lord Ganapathy, Hanuman, Nandi Bull and Lord Shiva in the form of Shivlinga. Yet another most significant of all the rock cut temples in this cultural state of India is the ‘Thrikkakkudi Rock-Cut Temple’ whose history can be traced back to the times of Pallava reign in the region somewhere around 8th century AD.</p> 
                                    <p>Situated on the banks of Manimala Rivier in the Kaviyoor village of Kerala, the temple stands as an important specimen to the ancient rock-cut temple art existing in the state and is preserved as a heritage monument by the state archaeological department. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple is carved from a huge rock and preserves some antique stone sculptures of great historical significance.</p> 
                                    <p>The unique feature of this temple is its 3 ft. high Shivlinga and sculptures of Lord Ganapati and Maharshi, all carved out from a single rock along with the cave chamber.A rock cut cave temple tour in Kerala remains incomplete without visiting the ‘Vizhinjam Cave Temple’ located in a tiny village, a short distance from the city of Thiruvananthapuram. A very small yet an important ancient shrine that is carved from a single granite rock, it enshrines a sculpture of Vinandhara Dakshinamurthy.</p> 
                                    <p>The real charm of this temple is undoubtedly, the half-complete relics of Lord Shiva with his consort, Goddess Parvati adorned on its outer walls; these incomplete engravings for sure arouse that sense of enigma making you wonder about the possible reasons that forced the then artisans to leave the carvings unfinished.</p> 
                                    <p>Yet another of a protected monument under the control of Archaeological Survey of India, the temple is a must visit if you are into ancient art & historical studies or an offbeat traveller who is always on a lookout to discover something new and interesting on every twist and turn of his travel odyssey.It is 23.4km from Thiruvananthapuram.</p>

                                    <p>Located on the foot of Veli Hills in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, a short distance from the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, the ‘Padmanabhapuram Palace’ dating back to 16th century AD is a true architectural marvel exuding an unmatched royal splendour of the kings of the erstwhile princely state of Travancore in India.</p> 
                                    <p>One of the must visit places in Kerala (though the palace lies in Tamil Nadu, it still comes under the administration of government of Kerala), the palace is sure to leave you astounded with its gorgeous interiors decorated with intricate rosewood & teakwood carvings, exquisite mural paintings and delicately sculpted figurines on pillars and columns throughout its halls and rooms.</p> 
                                    <p>Besides the palace’s rich interiors, its exceptional building technique and indigenous methods of craftsmanship in wood is something that needs a special mention; the palace is primarily constructed of timber with minimal use of stone and laterite. The carpenters have done an excellent job in working out the most complex of the angles with such a high degree of accuracy that there is seldom any use of metal nails to fix different beams together.</p> 
                                    <p>Also, you would be amazed to know that the floor of this magnificent structure has been built using organic materials like burnt charcoal, sea-shell lime, egg whites, river sand, curd and buttermilk. That is not all! A special attention has been given to lightening and shadowing work, that too in accordance with rules of vastushastra.</p> 
                                    <p>All in all, a gem of cultural and architectural legacies of Kerala, the ‘Padmanabhapuram Palace’ is truly a heaven for those with a penchant for ancient art and architecture of India. Needless to say, if you are in Kerala for a holiday, do visit this ancient site and take along with you, some beautiful memories of a memorable heritage tour in this cultural hub of India.It is 60.3km from Thiruvananthapuram.</p>

                                    <p>Well known for being the British East India Company’s first permanent trade post on the Malabar Coast, the ‘Anchuthengu Fort’ holds a great significance in Kerala’s colonial history. Built in 1699, the fort primarily started off as a site to promote company’s trade relations with various countries, it gradually transformed into a centre to store the military equipment and ammunitions.</p> 
                                    <p>Many important events associated with history of Kerala can be traced back to this fort; the ‘Attingal Rebellion of 1721’ wherein the local people, agitated with injustice of Britons sieged the fort and killed a contingent of 140 British traders, is still remembered as the first and one of the very crucial collective moves against the British rule in Kerala.</p> 
                                    <p>Though the rebellion was defeated by the British force, it triggered off a series of subsequent revolts to chase Britishers off the Indian subcontinent. Besides, the fort also played a significant role during the Anglo-Mysore war in 18th century wherein it served as a storehouse for the armoury and other equipment for British army.</p> 
                                    <p>Today, the fort enjoys the status of a national heritage monument and makes for one of the famous historical attractions in Kerala.Apart from being a site of high historical relevance, the fort’s aesthetical beauty sandwiched between the sea and backwaters makes it a favourite getaway for couples, families and nature lovers too who throng here to spend a day on the beach nestled on the foot of the fort. Needless to say, a soul soothing scenery of criss-crossed network of coconut trees fringed across the backwaters absolutely provide for a captivating spectacle that fills your hearts with peace and tranquillity.It is 28.5km from Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
