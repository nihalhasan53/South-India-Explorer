With Raja Ram Verma taking on the mantle as the ruler of the Kochi kingdom in 1790, Thrissur saw a fresh awakening, as it saw some beautiful architectural changes, administrative ones (what with controlling the aggressive rule of powerful chieftains), and also cultural ones.</p> 
                                    <p>Thrissur Pooram, the biggest Pooram, was his brainchild, in which people of all castes and backgrounds could participate.Thrissur witnesses a number of beautiful festivals like Pooram, Onam and Pulikakkali. The fact that big institutes like Kerala Sangeetha Natak Academy, Kerala Lalithakala Academy, and Kerala Sahitya Academy, are situated in Thrissur, indicates the intellectual kick that this city has.</p> 
                                    <p>It is also home to big traders of Kerala. And if this does not interest you enough, you have to gorge on to the beautiful delicacies of Thrissur like Puttu (a breakfast dish where rice is grounded into a cylindrical bamboo container), Vellayappam (a dish made out of a batter of rice and coconuts), and Meen Porichathu (a famous fish recipe of this area).It is 0.6km from Thrissur.</p>

                                    <p>Located in Peruvanam, Thrissur, the Peruvanam Mahadeva Temple is one of the most famous temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The opulent temple comprises of two shrines namely 'Irattayappan Temple' on the North and 'Maadathilappan Temple' on the South of the main temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The dual Shivalinga is the unique feature of the Irattayappan Temple which is the reason why its prime deity is also known as Irattayappan denoting the duality.</p> 
                                    <p>Madathilappan Temple's sanctum is considered to be the tallest one in South India. One of the most famous festivals which are celebrated in the temple is the Peruvanam Pooram. The Archaeological Survey of India has been protecting the temple since 1982.As per legends, after Saint Parashurama reclaimed Kerala from the sea, 64 Gramams were set up by him out of which Peruvanam Gramam was the most important one.</p> 
                                    <p>Pooru Vanam, who was the son of the King of Hasthinapura Yayathy, is believed to have created the temple. It is also thought that while a Shivalinga was being transported after receiving it at a lake near Badrinath, it got stuck on the branch of a tree after which the Madathilappan Temple, which stands today, was built at that spot.The temple which sprawls over 7 acres of land and is surrounded by a compound wall follows the Kerala style of architecture.</p> 
                                    <p>The sanctum sanctorum follows a square structure which is rarely seen in Indian temples. Also, the inner courtyard can be reached from two sides, i.e. east and west while the main entrance lies on the east. The Irattayappan shrine has been built on a circular base. Also, the Matatthilappan Temple is situated on the south and consists of three stories. Being one of the most prominent temple structures in Kerala, it should be given a visit. One is likely to get awestruck by the beauty of the temple and the peace that the surroundings provide.It is 11.4km from Thrissur.</p>

                                    <p>The temple is known for the depiction of Lord Shiva (who is the presiding deity) in various forms and also for other minor shrines dedicated to other Gods and Goddesses. The Thiruvanchikulam Mahadeva Temple has been given the oldest reference in the history of the ancient Tamil Sangam literature which clearly shows just how old the temple really is.

                                    <p>Established in 52 AD by St. Thomas and situated in Palayur, St Thomas Church is the oldest one in India and one amongst the seven that were founded by St. Thomas the Apostle. Legend has it that after St. Thomas landed at Palayur, he came across some Hindu Brahmins at the Thaliyakulam offering prayers and chanting mantras to God in the form of Tharpanam to the sun god.</p> 
                                    <p>Smiling at the sight of the Brahmins throwing water, he challenged them that the water that was being thrown by them was falling back into the tank instead of being accepted by the God. He told them that instead if he threw the water to his God, he would accept it and the water won't fall back in the tank. He also told them that if he won, of them would have to convert their religion and embrace Christianity.</p> 
                                    <p>He performed this miracle after which the Brahmins got converted to Christianity.Some improvements were made to its surroundings during the 17th century without abandoning the originality of the place. However, after the development was completed and the priest gave a proper lecture, the old wooden structure was agreed to be knocked down by the local people. The original altar which was sanctified by St. Thomas is still present at the site.</p> 
                                    <p>Since the church was built including an ancient Hindu temple which was abandoned, it follows a fusion of the Hindu architectural style and the Persian Church plan with the roof rising above the nave. Its entrance also resembles a Hindu Mandapa. The building was re-established in the 18th century after Tipu Sultan invaded Kerala and the church was wrecked by fire. The architectural significance and the history that the church boasts is enough to make one want to witness the place.It is 25km from Thrissur.</p>
