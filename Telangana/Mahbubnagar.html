                                    <p>As per history of this place, Lord Brahma, after losing his powers due to a curse of a saint, performed penance for Lord Shiva. It is believed that Lord Shiva appeared in nine different forms, thus nine different temples to celebrate each form. The shivalinga in the main temple of Bala Brahma temple is seen in the form of footprint of a bull.Jogulamba Temple is very ancient and one of 18 Maha Shakti Peethas of Goddess Shakti.</p>

                                    <p>The temple construction was initiated by Chalukya King Pulakesi II during his visit to Alampur while returning to Badami after his victory over Pallavas of Kanchi. Later, the rulers of Rashtrakuta and Kalyani Chalukya Empires have contributed to the enhancement of these temples. The Navabrahma temples, named as Bala Brahma, Taraka Brahma, Swarga Brahma, Padma Brahma, Garuda Brahma, Kumara Brahma, Arka Brahma, Vira Brahma and the Vishwa Brahma are built in close proximity on the banks of River Tungabhadra.</p>
