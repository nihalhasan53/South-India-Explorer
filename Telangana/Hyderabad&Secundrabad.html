                                    <p>Golconda Fort, a chief attraction of Hyderabad city, is situated towards the western outskirts of Hyderabad at a distance of about 11 km from the city centre.The word ‘Golconda’ originated from ‘Golla Konda’ which stands for ‘Shepherd’s Hill’ in Telugu. Golconda Fort came under the control of many dynasties like Yadava Dynasty, Kakatiya Dynasty, Bahmani Dynasty, Qutb Shahis and Mughal Dynasty.</p>
                                    <p>Golconda Fort was first constructed of mud by the rulers of Kakatiya Dynasty in the 13th century. It was later re-built in granite by the first three Qutb Shahis, which took about 62 years to complete. Golconda Fort was under the control of Qutb Shahis from 1518 AD to 1687 AD. Later, the Mughals invaded Golconda Fort and the fort was brought to ruins.The boundary wall of Golconda Fort that towers to a height of about 120 meters covers about 10 km.</p>
